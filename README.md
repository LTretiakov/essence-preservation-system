# Essence Preservation System

## Overview
This project proposes a formal model based on a simple principle:
**nothing does not affect something**.

Within this model, a neutral element `0` is introduced.  
Any interaction with `0` preserves the essence of an existing entity.

---

## Core Principle
If an entity `a` exists, then any interaction with `0`
does not change its essence:

- `a ⊕ 0 = a`
- `0 ⊕ a = a`

Where `⊕` denotes a generalized interaction operator.

---

## Interpretation of Zero
In this system, `0` is not treated as a numerical value,
but as the **absence of influence**.

Zero is not a number — it is a concept:

> “Nothing that changes nothing.”

---

## Project Goal
The goals of this project are:
- to formalize the principle of neutral interaction;
- to explore alternative interaction systems;
- to provide philosophical and logical reinterpretation of zero.

---

## Status
This project is in the conceptual formalization stage.
